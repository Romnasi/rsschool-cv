## Personal
I learn programming from May 2020. I want to become a front-end developer this year. Then I also plan to master the backend: node and python.

Married, have two kids.

I'm stubborn man with a healthy thirst for perfectionism. I enjoy learning and developing my skills and knowledge. I learn quickly and absorb information easily. 

If I don't know the answer - I'll find it.
